      <h1>Hello, I'm <span class="highlight">AJ Ashbrook</span></h1>
      <h2>Software Developer And CyberSecurity Student</h2>
      <p>I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity at Franklin University. I am on track to graduate in December of 2026. 
        I previously earned an associate degree in Software Development from Columbus State Community College in December of 2024.
      </p>
      <p> I initially pursued a degree in Electrical Engineering, 
        but an introductory technology course exposed me to programming, 
        where I quickly discovered a genuine enthusiasm and interest in the field. 
        Although learning to program was challenging at first, the guidance of my professors, support from peers, and consistent practice have helped me build a strong foundation. 
        After taking an introductory security course in my final semester at Columbus State, 
        I was inspired to continue my education in Cybersecurity.
      </p>
      <p>  I have always been intrigued by the complexities of online protection and the mechanisms behind cybersecurity.
         Understanding how technology can be secured and how to defend against cyber threats has become a driving interest for me. 
         I feel I have unique understandings of not just how to develop programs, but to ensure their security in the process.
        I am enthusiastic about deepening my expertise and applying my knowledge in real-world environments as I begin my professional journey.
