      <h1>Hello, I'm <span class="highlight">AJ Ashbrook</span></h1>
      <h2>Software Developer And CyberSecurity Student</h2>
      <p>I am currently a CyberSecurity student at Franklin University, pursuing my bachelor's degree.
  I am on track to graduate in the summer semester of 2026. Additionally, I earned my associate's degree in Software Development from Columbus State Community College in December 2024.
      </p>
      <p> I have developed a great passion for technology and I am very eager to start my career in software or CyberSecurity.
  My passion for technology has grown immensely, and I am eager to begin my career in software development or cybersecurity.
  I initially pursued a degree in electrical engineering, but an introductory technology course exposed me to programming, and I quickly discovered a genuine enthusiasm for it.
  Although learning to program was challenging at first, the guidance of my professors, support from peers, and persistent practice enabled me to develop a strong understanding of the field.
      </p>
      <p> Initially, I was going to stop at my associate's degree, but within my last semester, I took some intro security classes and decided I needed to learn more.
  While I originally planned to conclude my studies with an associate's degree, introductory security courses in my final semester inspired me to continue my education.
  I have always been fascinated by the intricacies of online protection and the mechanisms behind cybersecurity.
  Understanding how technology can be secured and how to defend against cyber threats has become a driving interest for me.
  I am enthusiastic about deepening my expertise in this field and look forward to applying my knowledge in real-world environments as I embark on my professional journey.
