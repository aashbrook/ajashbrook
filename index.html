      <h1>Hello, I'm <span class="highlight">AJ Ashbrook</span></h1>
      <h2>Software Developer And CyberSecurity Student</h2>
      <p>I am currently a CyberSecurity student at Franklin University, pursuing my bachelor's degree.
        I attend to graduate in the summer semester of 2026. I have also achieved my associate's degree in Software Development from Columbus State Community College in December 2024.
      </p>
      <p> I have developed a great passion for technology and I am very eager to start my career in software or CyberSecurity.
        I originally started my degree as a electrical engineering major, but during that time, I took a intro to technology class that introduced me to programming and I fell in love with it.
        At first, it was a bit difficult to learn, but with help from my professors, peers, and consistent practice, I have been able to achieve a higher level of understanding.
      </p>
      <p> Initially, I was going to stop at my associate's degree, but within my last semester, I took some intro security classes and decided I needed to learn more.
        It has always been an interest of mine to learn more about how to protect myself and others online.
        As well as how the security side of technology works and how to defend against attacks.
        I am very excited to learn more about this field and to be able to apply my knowledge in a real world environment as well as starting my career.
